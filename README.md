# POWERFUL PONG

> A classic Pong game with a bit more nice assets!

![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/U2QnZCNIQdSLM0kgKi/giphy.gif)

- This is a little improving test on a classic <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Pong.png">Pong</a> game
- Add a bit of juicy graphics and post-effects
- Every n seconds (randomly) a little container spanws on screen. You can hit it with the ball and try to get the magic pill generated from it
- Two kind of pills: super-speed and ice projectile
- Super-speed improves your speed twice for a period of time
- If you hit the opponent with the ice projectile, he'll freeze for few seconds

> Tips

- This project is complete, but is only a pattern you should use like a base to develop
- You can introduce a loop game (and, consequently, a game state machine) and an exit game system, instead of this brutal ALT-F4!
- You can create more than these pre-existing two pills, with other various effect (accelerate or slow ball, shield, "confusing" projectile that invert input for a period of time etc...)
- You can include more than two players, or substitute second human player with a more or less complex AI
- Of course you can also further improve graphics and sounds! This project has some quite cute VFX, but you can do MORE better!

- As I said before, this project is developed with Unity 2019 version. It's a very simple 2.5D project with most of the components builded from Unity basics 3D meshes
- There is a bit of graphic improvements with Unity Post-Processing Stack. This is absolutely an habit, but I think it gives a nice touch on all the global visual impact
- Textures are free assets from <a href="https://www.textures.com/" target="_blank">`textures.com`</a>
